          <p>My name is Sofia and I am 24 years old. In the summer of 2022, I took my bachelor's degree from the ICT, media and design program at Södertörn University. During my education I learned more about programming. I studied the basics in programming languages such as html, javascript, CSS, CMS PHP, Dart, P5.js and SQL. I have worked at Wellfish as a Junior Frontend developer. During my time at Wellfish, I learned more about structuring code, design and User experience. I learned more about programming languages such as Vue.js, CSS, HTML, Javascript and Typescript. </p>
            <br />
          <p>On my free time I like to dance salsa and be with friends and family. I've just finished a course called "Programmering fortsättning" at Distansakademin. In the course I have learned about the following programming languages; C#, HTML, Javascript, .Net Core WebAPI/MVC, Entity framework, Node js and Vue.js. I like Frontend development most because it is fun and exciting. It's fun to create websites and apps and to be able to be creative. It might be challenging but it is always fun to learn new things.</p>
            <br />
          <p>In my studies at Södertörn University I learned about User interaction design, User interfaces and User friendly design. I made a website to my uncle. When making the website to my uncle I followed the Design thinking process. The Design thinking process consist of 5 elements. Empathy phase, Define phase, Idea generation phase, Prototyping phase and Iteration phase. For example I used the Prototyping phase by making a Hifi-prototype in Figma. I also used the Iteration phase by having contact with my uncle during the process. 
           To see my projects go to "Projects". </p>
